# k8s-examples

## Requirements

-	Have Minikube Installed and tested https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
- Have Kubectl installed and able to run against Minikube https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
- Have Helm installed https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

## How to follow these examples

In each folder contains the yaml files needed to deploy things onto Kubernetes. Someday when @chiefalexander stops being lazy he will add README.md files to each folder explaining what they are and where to lookup more information on them, but for now going over these will be instructor led.
